## 👨‍🎓 Get involved

At the moment, Habbo servers need open development to build amazing software together, and there are some great “good first question” opportunities if you're looking to get involved.

- [Explore featured projects](https://github.com/orgs/rypi-dev/repositories)
- Use [repository issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) and not [contact@rypi.fr](mailto:contact@rypi.fr) to ask questions specific to an individual Rypî repository.

## 🤝 Contributing to the ecosystem

However, many restrictions are imposed because Rypî Development is a private source for some packages that should not be exposed publicly. Check out our [FAQ]() for more information.

Regardless of some contribution constraints, we have opened an [open-source office](https://github.com/rypi-dev/OSPO) in an effort to create a sane development community
